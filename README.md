# Drillbit
Drill through annoying fullscreen overlays!

*In the early 2000's Popup-Windows were so rampant that nowadays every webbrowser has an integrated Popup-Filter.
Now, we get tormented with Fullscreen Overlays we cannot skip*

**This Bookmarklet lets you remove them in one click!**

## How do fullscreen overlays work?

Websites that use fullscreeen overlays use JavaScript to mainly do two things:

- Create a [DIV element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp) which covers the whole window
- Remove your scrollbars so you can't scroll anymore

## What does Drillbit do?

- Drillbit lets you delete a single element at a time
- It also restores your scrollbars every time you use it

Basically, Drillbit lets you drill a hole through these overlays.

## How do I install Drillbit?

- [Download Drillbit](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Drillbit/archive/master.zip) and unpack it
- There is a file called DrillBit.URL in the folder you just unpacked
- Drag this file into the Favorites Bar of your Browser as shown in the animation above
- That's it! You're done! üëç

## How do I use Drillbit?

- Surf the web, until you want to remove something from a website
- Click the Drillbit Bookmarklet
- When you move the mouse over the website again, the element under your mouse will be colored yellow
- That's how you know which element is currently selected
- If you click on this element, you'll remove it

__**IMPORTANT: These fullscreen overlays often contain 2-3 layers on top of each other. Just run Drillbit as many times as you need! It will drill through one layer at the time until they're all gone!**__

Here's Drillbit in action again! The installation is literally done by dragging and dropping DrillBit.URL from the ZIP-File you can [download here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Drillbit/archive/master.zip) into your browser's favorite bar:

## Wait! AdblockPlus can do this - Why do I need your Bookmarklet?

You are right. Adblock Plus has the possibility to [Block elements](https://help.eyeo.com/adblockplus/block-item-or-element), and you should use this function whenever you can.

But using this function adds permanent entries to your Blacklist. Having a big filter list can slow down your browser.

This is where Drillbit comes in. It gives you the same functionality *without adding clutter to your Blacklist*.

- Use Drillbit if you want to remove something from a website you don't visit often.
- Use Adblock Plus [Block elements](https://help.eyeo.com/adblockplus/block-item-or-element) when you want to permanently remove something

- If you're browsing through Google Results, use Drillbit, because you'll probarbly never return to these sites again
- On the News-Sites you use daily, Adblock Plus [Block elements](https://help.eyeo.com/adblockplus/block-item-or-element) is the right tool
