## How do  fullscreen overlays work?

Websites that use fullscreeen overlays use JavaScript to mainly do two things:

- Create a [DIV element](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp) which covers your whole window
- Remove your scrollbars so you can't scroll down anymore

## What does Drillbit do?

- Drillbit lets you delete a single element at the time
- It also restores your scrollbars every time you use it

## How do I install Drillbit?

- [Download Drillbit](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Drillbit/archive/master.zip) and unpack it
- There is a file called DrillBit.URL
- Drag this file into the Favorites Bar of your Browser as shown in the animation above
- That's it! You're done! üëç

## How do I use Drillbit?

- Surf the web, until you want to remove something from a website
- Click the Drillbit Bookmarklet
- When you move the mouse over the website again, the element under your mouse will be colored yellow
- That's how you know which element is currently selected
- If you left-click this element, you'll remove it

__**IMPORTANT: These fullscreen overlays often contain 2-3 layers on top of each other. Just run drillbit as many times as you need!**__
